### Research field: 
Role of intestinal microbiota in inflammatory pathologies

### Research topic
The ‘Host-Microbiota Interaction’ lab (HMI) studies host-microbe interactions during the development of various immune disorders and colorectal cancer, using in-house developed transgenic mouse models and germ-free mouse technology. We have a historic interest in inflammatory diseases, and are using TNF overexpressing and A20 conditional knockout mouse lines. In addition, we have great interest in microbiota-driven colorectal cancer (CRC) development, using transgenic microbiota-dependent CRC mouse models. We are investigation both tumor promoting ‘onco-bacteria’ as well as beneficial bacteria during innovative anti-cancer therapies. We also study intestinal goblet-cell biology using unique transgenic approaches. The HMI-lab also established the first Belgian germ-free and gnotobiotic mouse facility a key technology platform for functional microbiota research. Our Facility can rederive transgenic disease models in germ-free conditions, in order to validate microbiota-dependency of various disease mechanisms, and study disease development in reductionistic gnotobiotic settings. Prof. Vereecke also coordinates the [‘Ghent Gut Inflammation Group’](https://www.ggig.be/), a research consortium around intestinal inflammation at Ghent University.
